This project includes starter notebooks for working with NoSQL databases, specifically aimed at analyzing and setting up NoSQL databases for various use cases.

## Project Files

- **NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook designed to help you analyze data stored in NoSQL databases. It provides an outline and examples for querying and interpreting data.
- **NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook aimed at guiding the setup process for NoSQL databases. It includes code snippets and instructions for creating and managing collections, documents, and other NoSQL features.
- **Resources: establishments.json**: Data file for database population

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Tools and examples for querying NoSQL data, filtering results, and generating insights.
- **Database Setup**: Step-by-step instructions for setting up collections, inserting documents, and managing indices.
- **Flexibility**: Designed for compatibility with various NoSQL databases, including MongoDB, Cassandra, and others.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- NoSQL database driver (e.g., `pymongo` for MongoDB)
- Dependencies as listed in the notebooks

## Usage

### Using Visual Studio Code

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code:
    ```bash
    code .
    ```
2. Install the recommended extensions for a smoother experience:
    - **Python**: For running Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts.
    - **Jupyter**: To work directly with `.ipynb` files within VSCode.
3. Open the desired notebook file (`NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb` or `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb`) directly in VSCode.
4. Use the integrated terminal in VSCode to install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Run the cells directly in VSCode or launch a Jupyter server if needed.

### General Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cbilinski101/nosql-challenge.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd NoSQL-Project
    ```
3. Install required dependencies (if any):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Open the Jupyter notebooks:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
5. Run the appropriate notebook based on your task:
    - **Setup**: Use `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb`.
    - **Analysis**: Use `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb`.
